# CodeSage

**CodeSage** is an AI-powered code analysis platform built using a **MERN-style architecture (without a database)**. It helps developers **identify, correct, and understand issues in their code**, including syntax errors, logical flaws, and general code quality problems.

Rather than just fixing code, CodeSage focuses on **explaining improvements**, enabling users to write **cleaner, more efficient, and more maintainable code**.
